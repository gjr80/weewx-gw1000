-   internal non-piezo rainfall related fields renamed with a 't_' prefix,
    eg: 't_rainrate', 't_rainday'

    rainfall related fields

    CMD_GW1000_LIVEDATA or CMD_READ_RAIN API response at the info (True) or the
    default debug (False) level
-   added support for (likely) rain source selection field (0x7A) appearing in
    CMD_READ_RAIN response
-   fix issue where day rain and week rain use a different format in
    CMD_READ_RAIN to that in CMD_GW1000_LIVEDATA
-   fix issue where sensor ID is incorrectly displayed for sensors with an ID
    ending in one or more zeros (issue 48)
-   removed gateway device field 't_rainhour' from the default field map
-   --live-data output now indicates the unit group being used
-   fake battery state data received from WH40 devices that do not emit battery
    state is now ignored
v0.4.2
-   fix bug in Station.rediscover()
v0.4.1
-   fix incorrect installer version number
v0.4.0
-   the device model (GW1000/GW1100) is now identified via the API so many
    references to 'GW1000' in console and log output should now be replaced
    with the correct device model
-   when used as a driver the driver hardware_name property now returns the
    device model instead of the driver name (GW1000)
-   reworked processing of queued data by class Gw1000Service() to fix a bug
    resulting is intermittent missing GW1000 data

-   re-factored debug_rain reporting to report both 'WeeWX' and 'GW1000' rain
    related fields
-   battery state data is now set to None for sensors with signal level == 0,
    can be disabled by setting option show_all_batt = True under [GW1000] in
    weewx.conf or by use of the --show-all-batt command line option
-   implemented the --units command line option to control the units used when
    displaying --live-data output, available options are US customary
    (--units=us), Metric (--units=metric) and MetricWx (--units=metricwx)
-   --live-data now formatted and labelled using WeeWX default formats and
    labels

-   fixed bug when operated with GW1100 using firmware v2.0.4
-   implemented limited debug_sensors reporting
-   implemented a separate broadcast_timeout config option to allow an
    increased socket timeout when broadcasting for GW1000/GW1100 devices,
    default value is five seconds
-   a device is now considered unique if it has a unique MAC address (was
    formerly unique if IP address and port combination were unique)
-   minor reformatting of --discover console output
-   WH24 battery and signal state fields are now included in the default field
    map
v0.3.1

    weewx.conf
-   fixed bug when decoding firmware version string that gives a truncated
    result
v0.3.0
-   added the --units command line option to allow the output of --live-data to
    be displayed in specified units (US customary or Metric)
-   added support for WH35 sensor
-   when run directly the driver now distinguishes between no sensor ID
    response and an empty sensor ID response
-   reworked battery state, signal level and sensor ID processing to cater for
    changes to battery state reporting introduced in GW1000 API v1.6.0 (GW1000
    v1.6.5 firmware)
-   The GW1000 cumulative daily lightning count field is now included in driver
    loop packets as field 'lightningcount' (the default field name). Previously
    this field was used to derive the WeeWX extended schema field
    'lightning_strike_count' and was not included in loop packets.
-   fixed incomplete --default-map output
-   fixes loss of battery state data for some sensors that occurred under
    GW1000 firmware release v1.6.5 and later
