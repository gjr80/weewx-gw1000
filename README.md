# Ecowitt Gateway (formerly GW1000) Driver

**Note:** The instructions and links in this readme have been produced for WeeWX v5. In general, the same concepts apply to earlier WeeWX versions; however, the detailed steps and commands required will be different. If you wish to persist with an earlier WeeWX version you may wish to refer to the [legacy installation instructions](https://github.com/gjr80/weewx-gw1000/wiki/Legacy-installation-instructions). Alternatively, you may find it easier to just upgrade to WeeWX v5 - after all it is free.

**Note:** General support issues for the Ecowitt Gateway driver should be raised in the Google Groups [weewx-user forum](https://groups.google.com/g/weewx-user "Google Groups weewx-user forum"). The Ecowitt Gateway driver [Issues Page](https://github.com/gjr80/weewx-gw1000/issues "Ecowitt Gateway driver Issues") should only be used for specific bugs in the Ecowitt Gateway driver code. It is recommended that even if an Ecowitt Gateway driver bug is suspected users first post to the Google Groups [weewx-user forum](https://groups.google.com/g/weewx-user "Google Groups weewx-user forum").

## Description

The Ecowitt Gateway driver (formerly the GW1000 driver) is a WeeWX driver that supports devices compatible with the Ecowitt LAN/Wi-Fi Gateway API.

The Ecowitt Gateway driver utilises the Ecowitt LAN/Wi-Fi Gateway API thus using a pull methodology for obtaining data from the gateway device rather than the push methodology used by other drivers. This has the advantage of giving the user more control over when the data is obtained from the gateway device.

The Ecowitt Gateway driver can be operated as a traditional WeeWX driver where it is the source of loop data, or it can be operated as a WeeWX service where it is used to augment loop data produced by another driver.

## Pre-Requisites

The Ecowitt Gateway driver requires WeeWX v3.7.0 or greater and will operate under Python2 or Python 3.

## Installation Instructions

### Installation as a WeeWX driver

**Note:** The following instructions are for installation under WeeWX v5.0.0 or later. For installation under earlier WeeWX versions refer to the [legacy WeeWX installation instructions](https://github.com/gjr80/weewx-gw1000/wiki/Legacy-installation-instructions).

1.  If the Ecowitt Gateway driver is to be installed on a fresh WeeWX installation first [install WeeWX](http://weewx.com/docs/5.0/usersguide/installing/) and configure WeeWX to use the *simulator* driver.

2.  Install the latest version of the Ecowitt Gateway driver using the [*weectl* utility](http://weewx.com/docs/5.0/utilities/weectl-extension/#install-an-extension). 

    **Note:** The exact command syntax to invoke *weectl* on your system will depend on the installer used to install WeeWX. Refer to [Installation methods](http://weewx.com/docs/5.0/usersguide/installing/#installation-methods) in the WeeWX [User's Guide](http://weewx.com/docs/5.0/usersguide/introduction/).

    For WeeWX package installs:

        weectl extension install https://github.com/gjr80/weewx-gw1000/releases/latest/download/gw1000.zip 
 
    For WeeWX *pip* installs the Python virtual environment must be activated before the extension is installed:

        source ~/weewx-venv/bin/activate
        weectl extension install https://github.com/gjr80/weewx-gw1000/releases/latest/download/gw1000.zip

    For WeeWX installs from *git* the Python virtual environment must be activated before the extension is installed:

        source ~/weewx-venv/bin/activate
        python3 ~/weewx/src/weectl.py extension install https://github.com/gjr80/weewx-gw1000/releases/latest/download/gw1000.zip

3.  Test the Ecowitt Gateway driver by running the driver file directly using the *--test-driver* command line option. 

    For WeeWX package installs use:

        PYTHONPATH=/usr/share/weewx python3 /etc/weewx/bin/user/gw1000.py --test-driver --ip-address=device_ip_address

    where *device_ip_address* is the IP address of the gateway device being used.

    For WeeWX *pip* installs the Python virtual environment must be activated before the driver is invoked:

        source ~/weewx-venv/bin/activate
        python3 ~/weewx-data/bin/user/gw1000.py --test-driver --ip-address=device_ip_address
 
    where *device_ip_address* is the IP address of the gateway device being used.
    
    For WeeWX installs from *git* the Python virtual environment must be activated before the driver is invoked using the path to the local WeeWX *git* clone:

        source ~/weewx-venv/bin/activate
        PYTHONPATH=~/weewx/src python3 ~/weewx-data/bin/user/gw1000.py --test-driver --ip-address=device_ip_address
 
    where *device_ip_address* is the IP address of the gateway device being used.

    You should observe loop packets being emitted on a regular basis. Once finished press *ctrl-c* to exit.

    **Note:** You will only see loop packets and not archive records when running the driver directly. This is because you are seeing output not from WeeWX, but rather directly from the driver. 

4.  Select and configure the driver.

    For WeeWX package installs use:

        weectl station reconfigure --driver=user.gw1000

    For WeeWX *pip* installs the Python virtual environment must be activated before *weectl* is used to select and configure the driver:

        source ~/weewx-venv/bin/activate
        weectl station reconfigure --driver=user.gw1000
 
    For WeeWX installs from *git* the Python virtual environment must be activated before *weectl.py* is used to select and configure the driver:

        source ~/weewx-venv/bin/activate
        python3 ~/weewx/src/weectl.py station reconfigure --driver=user.gw1000
 
5.  You may choose to [run WeeWX directly](http://weewx.com/docs/5.0/usersguide/running/#running-directly) to observe the loop packets and archive records being generated by WeeWX. If WeeWX is already running stop WeeWX before running the driver directly.

6.  Once satisfied that the Ecowitt Gateway driver is operating correctly you can restart the WeeWX daemon:

        sudo /etc/init.d/weewx restart
        
    or

        sudo service weewx restart

    or

        sudo systemctl restart weewx

7.  You may wish to refer to the [Ecowitt Gateway driver wiki](https://github.com/gjr80/weewx-gw1000/wiki) for further guidance on customising the operation of the Ecowitt Gateway driver and integrating gateway device data into WeeWX generated reports. 

### Installation as a WeeWX service

1. [Install WeeWX](http://weewx.com/docs/5.0/usersguide/installing/) and configure it to use either the *simulator* driver or another driver of your choice.

2. Install the Ecowitt Gateway driver extension using the *weectl* utility as per *Installation as a WeeWX driver* step&nbsp;2 above.

3. Edit *weewx.conf* and under the *[Engine] [[Services]]* stanza add an entry *user.gw1000.GatewayService* to the *data_services* option. It should look something like:

       [Engine]

           [[Services]]
               ....
               data_services = user.gw1000.GatewayService

4. Test the Ecowitt Gateway service by running the driver file directly using the *--test-service* command line option.

    For WeeWX package installs use:

        PYTHONPATH=/usr/share/weewx python3 /etc/weewx/bin/user/gw1000.py --test-service --ip-address=device_ip_address

    where *device_ip_address* is the IP address of the gateway device being used.

    For WeeWX *pip* installs the Python virtual environment must be activated before the driver is invoked:

        source ~/weewx-venv/bin/activate
        python3 ~/weewx-data/bin/user/gw1000.py --test-service --ip-address=device_ip_address
 
    where *device_ip_address* is the IP address of the gateway device being used.
    
    For WeeWX installs from *git* the Python virtual environment must be activated before the driver is invoked using the path to the local WeeWX *git* clone:

        source ~/weewx-venv/bin/activate
        PYTHONPATH=~/weewx/src python3 ~/weewx-data/bin/user/gw1000.py --test-service --ip-address=device_ip_address
 
    where *device_ip_address* is the IP address of the gateway device being used.

    You should observe loop packets being emitted on a regular basis.

    **Note:** When the Ecowitt Gateway driver is run directly with the *--test-service* command line option a series of simulated loop packets are emitted every 10 seconds to simulate a running WeeWX instance. The gateway device is polled and the gateway device data added to the loop packets when available. As the default gateway device poll interval is 20 seconds not all loop packets will be augmented with gateway device data.

    **Note:** You will only see loop packets and not archive records when running the service directly. This is because you are seeing the direct output of the simulated loop packets and the Ecowitt Gateway service and not WeeWX.

    Once finished press *ctrl-c* to exit.  

5.  You may choose to [run WeeWX directly](http://weewx.com/docs/5.0/usersguide/running/#running-directly) to observe the loop packets and archive records being generated by WeeWX. Note that depending on the frequency of the loop packets emitted by the in-use driver and the polling interval of the Ecowitt Gateway service, not all loop packets may include gateway device data; however, provided the gateway device polling interval is less than the frequency of the loop packets emitted by the in-use driver each archive record should contain gateway device data.

6.  Once satisfied that the Ecowitt Gateway service is operating correctly you can restart the WeeWX daemon:

        sudo /etc/init.d/weewx restart

    or

        sudo service weewx restart

    or

        sudo systemctl restart weewx

7.  You may wish to refer to the [GW1000 driver wiki](https://github.com/gjr80/weewx-gw1000/wiki) for further guidance on customising the operation of the Ecowitt Gateway driver and integrating gateway device data into WeeWX generated reports.
