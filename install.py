            fields
    9 January 2021      v0.2.0
        -   GW1000 config used by installer is now derived from a multiline
            string so as to allow embedded comments in installed config stanzas
        -   added extractors for sensor signal level fields
        -   use multiline string for [GW1000] config to allow comments to be
            included
        -   renamed various 24 hour average particulate concentration fields
    1 September 2020    v0.1.0 (b1-b12)
